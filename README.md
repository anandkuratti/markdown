Abstract - The Abstract and Index Terms text should be 10 point Times
New Roman, bold italic, fully justified, and contained within one
paragraph each. Begin the Abstract with the word “Abstract.” Do not
indent. Use a hyphen, not a long dash, after the word “Abstract.” The
Abstract should be about 150 - 200 words. Avoid using abbreviations. Do
not cite references in the Abstract. Leave a blank line between the
Abstract and Index Terms.

Index Terms - About four key words or phrases, in alphabetical order,
separated by commas, with only the first index term capitalized. All
terms following the initial term should be lowercase unless they are
proper nouns, in which case they should have an initial cap.

# Introduction

These instructions serve as a template for Microsoft Word and give you
the basic guidelines for preparing papers for ProComm 2024, July 14 -
17.

Please enable “Show Comments” and carefully follow these instructions to
ensure legibility and uniformity.

# Page Layout

When you open these guidelines, select "Print Layout" from the "View"
menu (View&gt; Print Layout), which will allow you to see the two-column
format. You may then type over sections by using the copy and paste
commands listed under the Edit menu (Edit&gt; Paste) into this document
and/or by using the markup styles. **We suggest you use this document as
your guide and simply copy and paste your text over the material in this
document.**

All printed material, including text, illustrations, and charts, must be
kept within a print area of 6-7/8 inches (17.5 cm) wide by 8-7/8 inches
(22.54 cm) high. Do not write or print anything outside the print area.
All text must be in a two-column format. Columns are to be 3-1/4 inches
(8.25 cm) wide, with a 5/16 inch (0.8 cm) space between them. Text must
be fully justified, with the body of the paper in Times New Roman 10pt
font.

Because the Proceedings will be provided in a digital format, color may
be used in the paper, but try to use colors that contrast well in black
and white.

Do not number the pages; all papers will be merged for the purpose of
creating the Proceedings, and page numbering will be applied at that
time.

Most full papers are around six pages in length. The maximum length is
eight pages, which includes references and all figures and/or tables.

## I. Main title

The main title (on the first page) should begin 1 inch (2.54 cm) from
the top edge of the page. It should be centered, in Times 24-point type.
Capitalize the first letter of nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and
adverbs; do not capitalize articles, coordinate conjunctions, or
prepositions (unless the title begins with such a word).

## II. Author name(s) and affiliation(s)

This section should include identifying information only when the final
camera-ready document is submitted.

Author names and affiliations are to be centered beneath the title and
printed in Times 12-point, non-boldface type. Multiple authors may be
shown in a two- or three-column format, with their affiliations below
their respective names. If only one author, center the information; if
two authors, use the left and right cells; three authors are shown
above; if more than three, create a new row and format appropriately,
leaving one blank line between rows of authors. Affiliations are
centered below each author name, italicized, not bold. Include e‑mail
addresses.

## III. Second and following pages

The second and following pages should begin 1.0 inch (2.54 cm) from the
top edge. On all pages, the bottom margin should be 1-1/8 inches (2.86
cm) from the bottom edge of the page for 8.5 x 11-inch paper (US Letter
size).

On the last page of your paper, try to adjust the lengths of the two
columns so that they are the same (automatically defined in section of
this template). Use automatic hyphenation and check spelling. Do the
best that you can.

# Typeface, Fonts, and Alignment

Wherever Times is specified, Times Roman or New Times Roman may be used.

## I. Main text

Type your main text in 10-point Times, single-spaced. Do not use
double-spacing. All paragraphs should be indented 1 pica (approximately
1/6- or 0.17-inch or 0.422 cm). Be sure your text is fully
justified—that is, flush left and flush right at the same time.
Sentences should be separated by one space only. Do not place any
additional blank lines between paragraphs. Apply Body Text Indent style.
Do not modify the styles used in this template.

##  II. Figures and tables

Figure and table captions should be 10-point Times, small caps,
left-justified (“Caption” in the Styles menu of this document).
Initially capitalize only the first word of each figure caption and
table title. Figures and tables must be numbered separately. For
example: “<span class="smallcaps">Figure 1. Database contexts</span>,”
“<span class="smallcaps">Table 1. Input data</span>.” If a figure or
table was not originated by the author, credit must be given to the
source in 9-point Times, left-justified type (“Source” in the Styles
menu of this document). Leave 1 point of space between the figure or
table and the source credit, and 6 points of space after the source
credit. Callouts should be 9-point Times, non-boldface.

Large figures and tables may span across both columns. Avoid placing
figures and tables before their first mention in the text. Use .PNG or
.JPEG formatting for embedded figures and images.

Figure captions are to appear below the figures. For figures, be sure to
include a label (Figure X), a title (a short non-sentence description),
and a caption (which explains in full sentences the meaning, purpose, or
ways of decoding the figure). Of course, cite your figure, too, if it is
taken from another source. See example with Figure 1 in this template.

<img src="&#39;./attachments/template&#39;/media/image1.png"
style="width:2.10347in;height:0.80208in" alt="placeholder" />

Source: Name and/or institution if image is not author’s. (Delete if not
used.)

Figure 1. Caption style for describing figures. Please read carefully
section II to understand how to format caption work for both figures and
tables.

Table titles are to appear above the tables. Table copy is identical to
copy in the main text: 10-point Times New Roman (“Normal” in the Styles
menu of this document). Table heads (and subheads if needed) use
10-point Times New Roman in boldface (“Table Head” in the Styles menu of
this document).

Leave 6 points of space between the table title and the table itself,
and 6 points of space after the table. Leave 6 points of space between
the text above the figure and 6 points of space after the figure
caption. Apply “Caption” style.

Figure axis labels are often a source of confusion. Try to use words
rather than symbols. As an example, write the quantity “Time” or “Time,
t” not just “t.” Put units in parentheses. Do not label axes only with
units. In the example, write “Magnetization (A/m)” or “Magnetization (A
⋅ m<sup>-1</sup>),” not just “A/m.” Do not label axes with a ratio of
quantities and units. For example, write “Temperature (K),” not
“Temperature/K.”

Multipliers can be especially confusing. Write “Magnetization (kA/m)” or
“Magnetization (10<sup>3</sup> A/m).” Do not write “Magnetization (A/m)
x 1000” because the reader would not know whether the top axis label in
figure means 15 000 A/m or 0.015 A/m.

Number equations consecutively with equation numbers in parentheses
flush with the right margin, as in (1). To make your equations more
compact, you may use the solidus ( / ), the exp function, or appropriate
exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, but not
Greek symbols. Use an em (long) dash rather than a hyphen for a minus
sign. Use parentheses to avoid ambiguities in denominators. Punctuate
equations with commas or periods when they are part of a sentence, as in

a + b = c.

Be sure that the symbols in your equation have been defined before the
equation appears or immediately following. Use “(1),” not “Eq. (1)” or
“equation (1),” except at the beginning of a sentence: “Equation (1) is
…”

Use a zero before decimal points: “0.25,” not “.25.” Use
“cm<sup>3</sup>,” not “cc.” Do not mix complete spellings and
abbreviations of units: “Wb<sub>2</sub>/m<sup>2</sup>” or “webers per
square meter,” not “webers/m<sup>2</sup>.” Spell units when they appear
in text: “…a few henries,” not “…a few H.”

Do not add any kind of pagination anywhere in the paper.

# First-Order Headings

First-order headings should use Times 10-point small-caps, with 12
points of space before and 6 points after. This format is set as
“Heading 1” in the Styles menu of this document. Capitalize the first
letter of nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs; do not
capitalize articles, coordinate conjunctions, or prepositions (unless
the heading begins with such a word).

## I. Second-order headings

As in this heading, second-order headings should be Times 10-point,
initially capitalized and italicized, flush left, with 9 points of space
before and 3 points after. This format is set as “Heading 2” in the
Styles menu of this document. Sections defined by second-order headings
should be numbered with upper-case Roman numerals, as in this document.

# Bullets and Numbered Lists

The recommended format for bulleted lists is as follows:

-   The lead-in sentence ends with a colon only if it is a complete
    sentence or ends with the words “as follows” or “the following.”

-   No blank lines should be used between the lead-in sentence and the
    list items.

-   List items (BulletList Style) should be indented 0.5 inches from the
    left margin and should use rounded bullets (no dashes, hyphens, or
    other symbols should be used).

For numbered lists you should follow these guidelines:

1.  Use where the order of the list is critical (NumberedList Style).

2.  Use the auto-numbering feature included in the NumberedList Style.

# Block Quote

If you need to offset text as block quotations of extracts, apply the
BlockQuote Style to your paragraph for the correct indentation. You do
not need to set quotation marks around the block.

Block Quote: Statements in the block quote will be indented and left
justified only to identify the content as different from the body text.

# Footnotes

To help your readers, avoid using footnotes altogether and include
necessary peripheral observations in the text (within parentheses, if
you prefer, as in this sentence).

# Acknowledgements (Optional)

If you wish to identify funding sources or significant contributions by
others, please include your acknowledgements at the end of your paper
but before the References. **Only include this information on the final
camera-ready copy.**

# References

List and number all references in 9-point Times, single-spaced, at the
end of your paper, with one blank line between each reference. This
format is set as “References Text” in the Styles menu of this document.
The names of authors in your references are formatted as the first
initial(s) of the authors followed by their last names. Use *et al.*
when three or more names are given, both in the in-text citations and in
the References section.

Number references consecutively in the text, and enclose the citation
number in square brackets (for example, \[1\]). The sentence punctuation
follows the bracket \[2\]. When citing a reference in your text, refer
simply to the reference number, as in \[3\]. Do not use “Ref. \[3\]” or
“reference \[3\]” except at the beginning of a sentence: “Reference
\[3\] was the first….” **Authors who use an alternative
reference/citation style will have their papers returned for
correction.**

Where appropriate, include the name(s) of editors of referenced books.
Do not use ibid. or op. cit references. For detailed information about
IEEE proceedings citations, consult the IEEE Style Guide at
<https://ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/IEEE-Reference-Guide.pdf>

Examples of references for common types of publications—journal
articles, books, and websites follow. You can use these examples to
verify your own work. IEEE format is used as in the *Transactions on
Professional Communication*, the source of these sample entries. If you
need to cite a source that does not fit one of these styles, you may
consult the Transactions, or its online submission instructions, for
other bibliographic references written in correct IEEE style.

Please note that references should not have active hyperlinks.

# About the Authors

The About the Authors section must begin 12 points below the references
section, using the same margins as the body. Describe each author in a
separate paragraph, skipping one line between authors. Try to limit the
information to 75 words or less, but it is okay to have more.

> <img src="&#39;./attachments/template&#39;/media/image2.tiff"
> style="width:0.99306in;height:1.25208in" />**Author Name** is a

Each author name should be bolded. You can apply the AuthorName
character style for this. An image is optional (width not to exceed
1-inch or 96 pixels).
